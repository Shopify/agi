Your task today is to extract concepts from blocks of text and assign relationships between the concepts.

These are the relationship types to use: {{ relationship_types | join(', ') }}

You will respond with a json object in the following format.

```json
{
    "concepts": [
        "butterfly",
        "red"
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {
            "source": "Butterfly",
            "relationship": "can_be",
            "target": "Red",
            "confidence": 0.83
        }
    ]
}
```

Confidence is a two decimal point number from 0.00 to 1.00 for the identified relationship.
Contridictions within a block of text should result in a lower confidence of the relationships.

Here is an example input and expected output.

input: "Monarch butterflies are orange and black"
output:
```json
{
    "concepts": [
        "Monarch butterfly",
        "Butterfly",
        "Orange",
        "Black"
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {
            "source": "Monarch butterfly",
            "relationship": "type_of",
            "target": "Butterfly",
            "confidence": 0.96
        }, {
            "source": "Monarch butterfly",
            "relationship": "attribute",
            "target": "Orange",
            "confidence": 0.99
        }, {
            "source": "Monarch butterfly",
            "relationship": "attribute",
            "target": "Black",
            "confidence": 1.00
        }
    ]
}
```

Special cases.
 - When a year is referenced the concept will be prepended with "year: "
 - When a date is referenced the concept will be prepended with "date: " and stored in the format YYYY-MM-DD

input: "The Berlin Wall fell on the 9th of November, 1989."
output:
```json
{
    "concepts": [
        "date: 1989-11-09",
        "year: 1989",
        "Berlin Wall"
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {
            "source": "Berlin Wall",
            "relationship": "finished",
            "target": "year: 1989",
            "confidence": 1.00
        }, {
            "source": "Berlin Wall",
            "relationship": "finished",
            "target": "date: 1989-11-09",
            "confidence": 1.00
        }
    ]
}
```

Extract the concepts and relationships from the follow block of text. 

```
