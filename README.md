# Artificial general intelligence, a Hack Days experiment

Emergence is when a complex system displays properties or behaviours that its individual elements do not possess, emerging solely from their interaction as a whole. Large Language Models enable semantic extraction and reasoning abilities and as such can be used to identify concepts and their relationships. This experiment will attempt to create emergent intelligence by using relationships between concepts identified by LLMs. Techniques have recently been developed to quantify emergence which we will use to optimise and validate our approaches.
